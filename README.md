This project is based on a Help Desk system I developed as part of my final year project.
I built it using Rust to practice backend development after learning from a Udemy course.

I followed the course as a guide, but I wrote the code myself and made some changes to improve my understanding.

Tech Stack:
- Rust
- Axum
- PostgreSQL (Diesel)
- Docker
